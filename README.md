# Title 

Password generator 

# Description 

This is and application designed to generate a randomized password for a User. The application functions by presenting the user with a series of prompts and confirms that will allow the user to select different specifications for the password. Once all the specifications have been chosen then the password will be created using a randomized for loop. The HTML and CSS for this project were taken from UCONN CODING BOOTCAMP but the javascript was input myself.
